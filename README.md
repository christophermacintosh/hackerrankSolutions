# hackerrankSolutions
Some of my solutions to hackerrank challenges.


# Languages
I'm doing most of these in C++ first, followed up by other languages mostly to help other people. I'm more or less porting my own code to other languages, but some examples I just rewrote and may not follow the same logic as another solution for the same challenge in a different language.

# Directory
Will put a directory here at some point to make navigating the repository easier.
